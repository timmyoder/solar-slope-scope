ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMERS:

This software was developed through experimental "vibe coding" methodologies 
with AI assistance. While based on established solar engineering principles 
and using validated libraries (pvlib-python), the implementations should be 
considered experimental and educational.

Users should:
- Verify results with professional solar engineering analysis
- Understand that terrain optimization suggestions are estimates
- Recognize that actual solar installations require qualified engineering review
- Use this tool for preliminary analysis and educational purposes

The authors make no claims regarding the accuracy of energy predictions or
the suitability of optimization recommendations for actual solar installations.
